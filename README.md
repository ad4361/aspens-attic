# Aspen's Attic

Welcome to Aspen's Attic! This is a mock estore web application that I created with a team of four other software developers as part of a semester-long project for SWEN 261 Intro to Software Engineering. Aspen's Attic is an estore that sells wood carving products to online customers. Our site provides an accessible shop page for customers to make purchases and owner(s) to view and edit their shop.

Since this project was for a class that is still assigning this project to current students, I cannot publicly post its code in this repository. However, I will be including our design document and screenshots of Aspen's Attic in this repository.
